# ScholaFlow

ScholaFlow is an open-source learning management system (LMS) that aims to improve upon the foundation of existing platforms like Google Classroom. We're not just checking boxes â€“ we're focused on features that genuinely enhance the learning experience.

## Key Differences:

- **Visual Feedback:** Embed images directly in comments. Because sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words (especially in feedback).
- **Seamless Communication:** Integrated group chat eliminates the need for external communication tools. Keep conversations centralized and focused.
- **Integrated Note-Taking:** A built-in personal notes section (think Google Keep) helps students and educators stay organized within the platform.

## Beyond the Basics:

ScholaFlow offers the core functionality you expect from an LMS (assignments, grading, announcements), but with a focus on:

- **Intuitive Interface:** Minimize the learning curve with a familiar design.
- **Efficient Workflow:** Streamline tasks and communication for both teachers and students

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or higher
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account (sign up for free at [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/))

### Installation

1. **Set up a Supabase Project:**

   - Go to the Supabase Dashboard and create a new project.
   - Choose a region and name for your project.
   - Wait for the project to be provisioned (this might take a few minutes).

2. **Set up NextAuth.js with Google Provider:**

   - Follow the official NextAuth.js guide for setting up the Google provider: [https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google)

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to "Settings" -> "API".
   - Copy the `anon` key (public API key) and the `service_role` key (used for server-side access).
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your ScholaFlow project.
   - Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your Supabase values:

     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[Your Supabase Project URL]
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=[Your Supabase Anon Key]
     ```

   * You will need to configure your Google provider by setting the environment variables `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`. Refer to the guide linked below for more details on obtaining these.
   * **Important:** The `.env` file should be added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing sensitive API keys to version control.

4. **Clone the repository:** `git clone git@github.com:LuisCabantac/scholaflow.git`
5. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd ScholaFlow`
6. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
7. **Start the Development Server:** `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
8. **Access ScholaFlow:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your setup).
