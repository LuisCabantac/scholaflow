## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account (sign up for free at [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/))

### Installation

1. **Set up a Supabase Project:**

   - Go to the Supabase Dashboard and create a new project.
   - Choose a region and name for your project.
   - Wait for the project to be provisioned (this might take a few minutes).

2. **Set up Better Auth with Google Provider:**

   - Follow the official Better Auth guide for setting up the Google provider: [https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google)

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to "Settings" -> "API".
   - Copy the `anon` key (public API key) and the `service_role` key (used for server-side access).
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your ScholaFlow project.
   - Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your Supabase values:

     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[Your Supabase Project URL]
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=[Your Supabase Anon Key]
     ```

   * You will need to configure your Google provider by setting the environment variables `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`. Refer to the guide linked below for more details on obtaining these.
   * **Important:** The `.env` file should be added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing sensitive API keys to version control.

4. **Clone the repository:** `git clone git@github.com:LuisCabantac/scholaflow.git`
5. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd ScholaFlow`
6. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
7. **Start the Development Server:** `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
8. **Access ScholaFlow:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your setup).
